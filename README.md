## OpenCV_Spatez

This program uses the OpenCV library to detect a marker when placed on the Field of View of the camera. Also, the program prints the relative distance of the marker from the camera.

Pressing **P** will capture a screenshot from the video feed. 
Pressing **Q** will exit the program.

The entire video feed is saved in a video file called 'output.avi'
